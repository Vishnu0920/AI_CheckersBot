This is checkers simulation where two bots play against each other.
There are two algorithms group1.py and group2.py.
group1.py is an algorithm that randomly selects the best move
group2.py is the algorithm that applies minimax and alpha-beta pruning to come up with the best moves
When main.py is run it opens the GUI where we can select which algorithm each of the two sides will use.
